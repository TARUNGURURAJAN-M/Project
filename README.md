# Project
 Movie Success Prediction and Sentiment Study:
This project explores the factors that contribute to a movie’s success using both structured data (like budget, genre, cast) and unstructured data (user reviews). It predicts success using machine learning models and performs sentiment analysis on audience feedback to derive insights. The pipeline is built with Python, stored in SQLite, and visualized through Power BI or Tableau.

1. 📌 Project Overview:
A hybrid ML + NLP project to analyze and predict the success of movies based on metadata and audience reviews. It helps identify key success factors and maps user sentiment to commercial performance.

2. ⭐ Features:
🎯 Predict movie success (hit/flop or box office revenue)

💬 Analyze user sentiment from IMDb/Twitter reviews

📊 Feature importance from metadata (cast, director, genre)

📈 Correlation of sentiment with movie performance

📉 Interactive dashboards and model insights

3. 🧰 Tools Used:
Languages & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy

ML Models: Scikit-learn, XGBoost

Sentiment Analysis: TextBlob, NLTK, VADER

Database: SQLite

Visualization: Power BI / Tableau / Streamli

4. ⚙️ Installation:
Install the required Python libraries:
pip install pandas scikit-learn textblob nltk matplotlib seaborn sqlite3
Download and set up Power BI or Tableau if required.

5. 🚀 Usage:
bash
